Business::KontoCheck version 2.2
================================

This module checks the validity of German and Austrian Bank Account Numbers.
All currently defined test methods by Deutsche Bundesbank (currently: 00 to
C6, September 2007) are implemented.

The Österreichische Bundesbank uses a quite different approach. The basic
tests are more generic; the concrete tests are described by the hash file,
which is sold by First Data Austria, Wien. Specifications may be downloaded
from http://www.firstdata.at/de/service/downloads.htm.

The original library is a C library; the Perl port was build using the h2xs
tool.

Due to performance considerations in the C library, this module is not thread
safe. But since KontoCheck is *very* fast and it's not a great speed loss, I'll
implement a thread safe version in the next major release (planned for this year).

If you want support only for german or only for austrian Bank Account Numbers,
edit line 15 of Makefile.PL. To use only the german module, use
-DINCLUDE_KONTO_CHECK_AT=0, to use only the austrian module, use
-DINCLUDE_KONTO_CHECK_DE=0.

A longer description and the history file are included as 00liesmich.txt and
0_history.txt (both in german). The C library is available from
http://www.informatik.hs-mannheim.de/konto_check


DOCUMENTATION

The C source code contains the description of each check method. A synopsis
and short description of all exported functions is included in the file
lib/Business/KontoCheck.pm; this is can be read after installation using the
command "perldoc Businesss::KontoCheck".
